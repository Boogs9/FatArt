# Fat_Art

This is a collection of fatness represented in museums.

The rationale behind this project is to explore the frequency and art mediums used to represent fatness in museums.

For this project, I used the request library to make API calls, pandas to set up data frames, and Matplotlib to analyze data and display images of the art. 

Someone might build on this work if they're interested in the representation of fat people in art and they can use this as a springboard to critique cultural institutions.
